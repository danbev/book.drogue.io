= The edge

The edge brings together devices and the cloud side if that is required. If that is just onboarding traffic to an IP-based network, or bringing processing logic closer to devices depends on each use case. Thus edge nodes sometimes look more like a device in some cases, and more like _the cloud_ in others.

Drogue IoT currently doesn't provide any specific edge components. But it ensures that edge devices are part of the system in many different ways. Like having the concept of a "gateway device", providing demos on how to run edge workload using containers, integrating with the cloud.
